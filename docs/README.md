## üìù Documentation Guidelines

### Where to Add New Documentation

**Workspace docs** ‚Üí `/workspace`
- Contribution guidelines (how to contribute)
- Release processes (how to release)
- CI/CD changes
- Development workflows
- Testing strategies
- Security policies

**Project docs** ‚Üí `/project`
- Product roadmaps
- Changelogs (what changed)
- Meeting notes
- Feature planning

**Product docs** ‚Üí `/product`
- User-facing features
- API specifications
- Usage examples
- Architecture overviews

**Component-specific docs** ‚Üí Component's own `/docs` folder
- Implementation details for a specific package
- Component-specific API documentation
- Internal architecture of a component

**Historical/completed work** ‚Üí `/archive`
- Refactoring summaries

### Documentation Principles

1. **Keep it DRY** - Don't duplicate documentation. Link to canonical sources.
2. **Audience-first** - Write for your target audience (users vs. contributors).
3. **Living documents** - Update docs when code changes.
4. **Component ownership** - Technical details belong in component docs, not workspace docs.
5. **Archive completed work** - Move implementation summaries to archive once complete.
