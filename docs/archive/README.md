## üéØ Purpose

This archive serves as a historical record of:

- **Refactoring decisions** - Why and how we refactored code
- **Implementation details** - Technical details of completed features
- **Technical decisions** - Architecture and design choices
- **Migration guides** - How we migrated from old to new approaches

## üìù When to Archive

Move documentation here when:

- ‚úÖ The work is complete and merged
- ‚úÖ The document describes implementation details rather than current architecture
- ‚úÖ The document is a refactoring summary or migration guide
- ‚úÖ The information is historical but may be useful for understanding past decisions

## üîç When to Use Archive

Consult the archive when:

- Investigating why a particular approach was chosen
- Understanding the history of a component
- Researching past refactorings
- Debugging issues related to past changes
- Learning from past technical decisions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Not actively maintained** - These documents reflect the state at the time of writing
- **May be outdated** - Code may have evolved since these were written
- **Historical reference only** - For current documentation, see `/docs/products/anygpt` or component docs
- **Useful for context** - Helps understand the evolution of the codebase
