# Model Benchmarking

## The Problem

No easy way to compare model performance across providers. Which model gives best results for your specific prompts? How do response times compare? What's the cost difference? Manual testing is time-consuming and results are inconsistent.

## The Solution

Built-in benchmarking tool to compare models across providers.

## Example

```bash
# Compare models on your specific prompts
anygpt benchmark \
  --models gpt-4o,claude-sonnet,llama3 \
  --prompt "Explain quantum computing" \
  --iterations 10
```

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Manual testing**: Time-consuming, inconsistent
- **No cost tracking**: Hard to compare value
- **Single provider**: Can't compare across providers

## Expected Results

**Scenario:** You need to choose a model for a code explanation feature.

**Benchmark Output:**
- GPT-4o: 95% accuracy, $0.03/request, 2.3s avg response time
- Claude Sonnet: 92% accuracy, $0.015/request, 1.8s avg response time  
- GPT-3.5: 78% accuracy, $0.002/request, 0.9s avg response time

**Decision:** Claude Sonnet gives 97% of GPT-4o quality at 50% cost. Choose Claude Sonnet, save ~$1,500/month on 100k requests.

**Measurable Impact:**
- Reduce model selection time from weeks to hours
- Quantify cost/quality tradeoffs with real data
- Avoid over-paying for unnecessary quality
