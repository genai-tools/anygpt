# Rapid Prototyping & Testing

## The Problem

Testing AI features costs money - hundreds of test runs add up. Network calls slow down test suites. Non-deterministic responses make tests flaky. Rate limits block CI/CD pipelines. Need API keys in test environments.

## The Solution

Mock connector with deterministic responses. Test without API costs or network dependencies.

## Example

```typescript
// Test config
providers: {
  'test': { connector: mock({ responses: ['Hello!', 'How can I help?'] }) }
}

// Tests run fast, deterministic, free
const response = await router.chatCompletion({
  provider: 'test',
  model: 'mock',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hi' }]
});
// Always returns 'Hello!'
```

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Real API calls**: Slow, expensive, rate-limited
- **No mocking**: Hard to test AI interactions
- **Non-deterministic**: Flaky tests

## Expected Results

**Scenario:** Test suite with 200 AI interaction tests.

**Without mocks:**
- 200 tests × $0.01/call = $2 per test run
- 50 CI runs/day = $100/day = $3,000/month
- Tests take 10 minutes (network calls)
- Flaky tests due to non-deterministic responses
- Rate limits block CI pipeline

**With mock provider:**
- 200 tests × $0 = free
- 50 CI runs/day = $0/month
- Tests take 30 seconds (no network)
- 100% deterministic, zero flaky tests
- No rate limits

**Measurable Impact:**
- Save $3,000/month in test API costs
- Reduce test suite time by ~95%
- Eliminate flaky tests completely
- Prototype features before API setup
