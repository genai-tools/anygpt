# Persistent Conversations

## The Problem

Chat history is lost when the process ends. Each new session starts from scratch. Developers must implement their own storage, serialization, and context management. Multi-turn conversations require manual message tracking and state management.

## The Solution

Built-in conversation management with persistent storage. Continue conversations across sessions.

## Example

```bash
# Start a conversation
anygpt conversation start --name "coding-help"

# Add messages (history is preserved)
anygpt conversation message "How do I implement a binary tree?"
anygpt conversation message "Show me the insertion method"

# Resume later
anygpt conversation list
anygpt conversation resume "coding-help"
anygpt conversation message "What about deletion?"
```

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Stateless APIs**: No built-in history management
- **Manual tracking**: Developer must implement storage
- **Session-based**: Lost when process ends

## Expected Results

**Scenario:** Building a coding assistant used across multiple sessions.

**Without persistence:**
- User explains project context every session
- Loses progress when terminal closes
- Can't reference previous discussions
- Frustrating user experience

**With persistent conversations:**
- User starts conversation once, continues for days
- Context preserved: "Remember the auth system we discussed?"
- Can review conversation history
- Seamless experience across sessions

**Measurable Impact:**
- Reduce repeated context explanations by ~80%
- Improve user satisfaction significantly
- Enable long-term projects spanning multiple sessions
- Build conversation history for better responses
