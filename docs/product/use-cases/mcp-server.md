# MCP Server for Cross-Component Agents

## The Problem

MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Windsurf) are locked to their default providers. Can't use local models, can't switch providers, can't build multi-agent systems with different models. Each tool is siloed.

## The Solution

MCP server that translates between MCP protocol and any AI provider. Enables cross-component agent orchestration.

## Example

```json
// Claude Desktop config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anygpt": {
      "command": "anygpt-mcp",
      "env": { "OPENAI_API_KEY": "..." }
    }
  }
}
```

Now Claude Desktop can use OpenAI, Ollama, or any configured provider.

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Provider-specific**: Each MCP client tied to one provider
- **No flexibility**: Can't switch providers
- **No local models**: Cloud-only

## Expected Results

**Scenario:** Build a chess-playing agent using Claude Desktop + local chess engine.

**Without MCP bridge:**
- Claude Desktop locked to Anthropic
- Can't use local models
- Can't integrate custom tools
- Single-agent limitation

**With MCP server:**
- Claude Desktop → AnyGPT MCP → Multiple providers
- Chess agent uses GPT-4 for strategy, local model for evaluation
- Integrate chess engine as MCP tool
- Multi-agent orchestration possible

**Measurable Impact:**
- Enable cross-component agent architectures
- Use best model for each task (strategy vs evaluation)
- Reduce costs by using local models where appropriate
- Build complex multi-agent systems with existing MCP clients
