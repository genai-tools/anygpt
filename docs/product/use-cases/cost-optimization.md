# Cost Optimization

## The Problem

AI costs spiral quickly. GPT-4 costs $0.03/1k tokens, GPT-3.5 costs $0.002/1k tokens - 15x difference. Using premium models for simple tasks wastes money. Using cheap models for complex tasks wastes time with poor results. No middle ground.

## The Solution

Route requests based on complexity. Simple queries use cheap models, complex ones use premium models.

## Example

```typescript
// Route by task complexity
providers: {
  'cheap': { connector: openai({ model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }) },
  'premium': { connector: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }) }
}

// Application logic decides routing
const provider = isComplexTask ? 'premium' : 'cheap';
```

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Single model**: One size fits all approach
- **Manual routing**: Complex logic in application code
- **No cost tracking**: Hard to measure savings

## Expected Results

**Scenario:** Customer support chatbot handling 1M requests/month.

**Before:** All requests use GPT-4 ($0.03/1k tokens)
- Cost: ~$30,000/month
- Quality: Excellent for all queries

**After:** Route by complexity
- 70% simple queries → GPT-3.5 ($0.002/1k tokens): $420
- 30% complex queries → GPT-4 ($0.03/1k tokens): $9,000
- Total cost: ~$9,420/month

**Measurable Impact:**
- Save ~$20,000/month (68% cost reduction)
- Maintain quality where it matters
- Simple queries still get instant, accurate responses

## Real-World Example

See our [Chess Game Exercise](./cross_agent_interaction/chess-game-exercise.md) for a detailed case study on cost optimization through intelligent model routing. The exercise demonstrates:

- **Orchestrator + Specialist pattern**: Fast model (Gemini Flash) handles 80% of decisions, expensive model (Claude Sonnet) only for critical moves
- **Stateless context compression**: Using FEN notation keeps context constant (~50 chars) regardless of game length
- **Token reduction**: 80-90% reduction compared to traditional conversation history approach
- **Cost savings**: Significant reduction in API costs while maintaining strategic quality

This pattern applies to any multi-step workflow where some decisions are routine and others require deep reasoning.
